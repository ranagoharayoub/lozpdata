                Machine learning is employed to create algorithms that will
                receive the input file and use statistical analysis to predict
                the output, based upon the sort of knowledge available. These
                machine learning algorithms are classified as supervised,
                unsupervised, and reinforcement learning whereof these
                algorithms has various limitless applications like Image
                Recognition, Voice Recognition, Predictions, Video Surveillance,
                Social Media Platform, Spam and Malware, Customer support,

                There are several applications of Machine Learning and there are
                a lot of machine learning algorithms are available to learn.
                They are available in every form from simple to highly complex.
                Some of the uses of this vast technology are as follows:

                Image recognition is one of the most common uses of machine
                learning applications. Face recognition is also one of the great
                features that have been developed by machine learning only. It
                helps to recognize the face and send the notifications related
                to that to people which is mostly used in traffic lights and
                roads to maintain traffic rules.

                Machine learning also helps in developing the application for
                voice recognition. It is also referred to as virtual personal
                assistants. It will assist you to seek out knowledge when asked
                over the voice. After your question, that assistant will look
                out for the info or the knowledge that has been asked by you and
                collect the specified information to supply you with the best
                answer. There are many devices available in today’s world of
                Machine learning for voice recognition that's Amazon echo and
                googles house are smart speakers.

                It helps in building the applications that predict the worth of

                where are often found. While booking the cab and therefore the
                app estimates the approximate price of the trip that's done by
                the uses of machine learning only. When we use GPS service to
                check the route from source to destination, the app will show us
                the various ways to go and check the traffic at that moment for
                the lesser number of vehicles and where the congestion of
                traffic is more that's done or retrieved by the uses of the

                the uses of machine learning only. There are many examples like
                friend suggestions, page suggestions for Facebook, songs, and
                videos suggestion on YouTube. It mainly works on the
                straightforward concept based on the user’s experience, with
                which they are getting connected and visit the profiles or
                websites very often, suggestions are providing to the user
                accordingly. It also provides the technique to extract useful
